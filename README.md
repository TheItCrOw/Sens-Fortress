Sen's fortress is a desktop based, open source and completly free password manager, that runs on Windows only (for now). It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (short: AES) in combination with Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (short: PBKDF2) for storing data savely on your harddrive, while also implementing other security features, which will be elucidated further down below. 

## Getting started
![SensFortress View_EOMMUfUtlv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49918134/74938684-c0c9e480-53ee-11ea-91e0-4b199d202e70.jpg)

### Prerequisites
#### Usage
* [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/) - Sen's fortress is windows only (for now)
* [.NET Core runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - Runtime required for using Sen's fortress

```
Download the latest .zip version of the Release folder and run the SensFortress.View.exe
Make sure the application has the rights to read and write files from and onto your harddrive.
```

#### Developing
* [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - SDK required for deveolping Sen's fortress
* [Visual Studio / WPF](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) - Graphical framework.

#### External libraries / Nuget packages

* [Prism.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Prism.Wpf/) - MVVM framework
* [Live Charts.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LiveCharts.Wpf/) - Charts / Graphs library
* [Material Design](https://material.io/resources/) - UI designing language 

```
Clone the repository.
Make sure all Nuget packages and externally added libraries are referenced. (VS should do this by itself - if not, it will tell you what's missing. You must then download these packages yourself.)
Make sure VS has full writing access. (Try starting as admin if it does not work initially.)
Build the solution.
Start
```

### Technologies

* C#
* .NET Stack / .NET Core 3.0
* WPF => MVVM
* Visual Studio 2019

## About / Sen's fortress mission

Sen's fortress is currently completly offline. Against the trend of many other password managers, there are no future plans in implementing a cloud structure - instead a local synchronisation progress with other instances (PC's, Mobile-apps) in a closed network (Home WiFi) will be featured.

### Why no cloud?
Let's adress the elephant in the room immediately. Anyone that has been interested in Cryptography may have heard about some standard procedures which password managers perform, to obtain maximum security for highly sensitive data such as your passwords.

* AES
* Hashes
* SSL/TCP
* VPN
* SSH

so on and so forth. The inner conflict of anyone that tries to develop a password manager now lies in the combination of comfort and security. How much comfort is the user ready to sacrifice in order to actually use a password manager, while also being provided the highest level of security. **The answer is: pretty damn little.**
It is actually so little that password managers today focus more on developing new comfort features than actually trying to increase the level of security. To push this even further, one may throw in the daring statement: **They are ready to sacrifice security for comfort**.

Let's elaborate on this statement.
There are some that critizise password managers on very deepest level: **Storing passwords on the harddrive in the first place instead of just remembering or writing them down.** While it is true that a hacker/virus cannot steal something that is not a computer, they can certainly leak databases of big coorporations thousands of miles away from your home PC or your notepad. In this case there is only one thing that decides whether your passwords will be leaked or not: **The password itself.**
Spoiler alert: Anyone that has thought "password123" was a good idea will be in for a rude awakening. 
Others however who may have used a password manager and actually used it properly can calmly relax: Generated strong passwords such as: *Y!Y-iuicn.h;gT/RqUtfY$uI<yFH/D>g* have a 99,99% of not being leaked. They are however pretty difficult to memorize or written down. **And that is why you should use a password manager.** 

In the age of digitalisation where your internet identity is no longer just that one silly ICQ or myspace account but your whole sensible online banking credibility, a password manager should remind everyone that it is crucial to be caucious, preventively and save and in that matter helps achieving these conditions. That is the core of any password manager. **Well, it should be.**

Somewhere along the road of the last years that core principle of any password manager has slowly been forgotten. It is now a race of: Which password manager on the market takes the least clicks to set up and use. Which software provides the least effort for me to have my passwords anywhere at any time on every hardware I have without me even copy and pasting in the passwords on a website. Are the developers or coorporations to blame for that? The answer is pretty obvious. **The market provides what the customer wants.** In a time where people actually order water and food from amazon instead of going to the supermarket down the street, it's pretty much no surprise.   

As a consequence, browser extensions that store and autofill in your password are being developed in **javascript** - a programming language that was initially developed for dynamic webbrowsers - a language so easy to use and modify that it offers any attacker a simple API will be in charge of all your passwords. It's no wonder that countless security holes have been popping up left and right. 

*Using such an extension is like going to the cinema and standing before a cashbox but being to lazy to actually pull out your wallet, so you gave 100$ beforehand to a random person outside the building so he can pay for you while you just walk through.*

Quick tip: **Do not use browser extensions that handle sensible data.**

This is of course topped by - and we finally adress the elephant in the room - the concept of the **cloud**.
All of your passwords will be available to you at any time on any hardware you'd like (provided there is a stable internet connection). You no longer need to worry about losing your passwords on your computer or not having access to them on your secondary laptop. The cloud saves you RAM, CPU and storage. So why would I still never even consider using the cloud of any provider? 

*Using the cloud for storing passwords is like giving that random person not only the 100$, but tellimg him to run 100 feet away from you, so you can throw him your whole wallet with credit card, Id, driver license and banking accounts so he can make sure that everything is in order, you always have enough money in your wallet and you never have to worry about **your** additions.*

This example is obviously over the top. You would hide your wallet in a carton before throwing it and the random person would never get the key to the carton. The rest is however pretty accurate.

There are three main reasons which have already been described in the example afore why people tend to use the cloud:

* Synchronization

Now that you use a password manager you can no longer memorize any of your login credentials. If at some point you wanted to login to a website outside of your usual work enviroment you must have some access to your password manager. The cloud makes sure that you can access them from anywhere you want without you having to do anything.
You could however, right before you leave, start a manual synchronization process within your own closed WiFi network that automatically shares all passwords on the every hardware you've chosen. If you then leave and add/edit passwords you will have them at you and when you are at home again, you simply synchronize again. (A feature that will soon be in Sen's fortress)

* Backups

The cloud of course mirrors each hardrive in a given interval, making sure that all your passwords remain save even when servers start burning. Backing up passwords however is so easily done at home: All you need is a USB-Stick or anything that can store data and one click of a button. You can even schedule automatic backups that will do the job for you. (Already implemented in Sen's fortress). All that without using the cloud or any internet connection.

* Responsibility

The cloud manages your most sensible data for you. It will make sure that:
Your data is being backed up. Your data is at a save place. You can access this data from anywhere you'd like.

You do not have to worry about any of these things and if anything happens you can blame a big cooporation for that. This might not be mentioned often but I do believe that this plays a huge role on why the cloud is so widely spread.
