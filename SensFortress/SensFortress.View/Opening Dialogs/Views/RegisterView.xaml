                            Sen's Fortress is a tool that encrypts the data that it's given (normally passwords) and stores them for you. <LineBreak/>
                            The data is encrypted with the help of a cryptographic hash function: SHA-512. This method was designed by the National Security Agency (NSA).
                            Just so you can understand the level of security this fortress has to offer. <LineBreak/>                           
                            "512" represents the amount of Bits, that the function ends up producing. Everything that is being encrypted will be compromised into 512 Bits. <LineBreak/>
                            As an example: A password such as "password123" (which is a very, very bad password) will look like this after the encryption: <LineBreak/>
                            <LineBreak/>
                            BED4EFA1D4FDBD954BD3705D6A2A78270EC9A52ECFBFB010C61862AF5C76AF1761FFEB1AEF6ACA1BF5D02B3781AA854FABD2B69C790DE74E17ECFEC3CB6AC4BF <LineBreak/>
                            <LineBreak/>
                            However, it is very important to understand that such encryption is a one-way compression. Once it's encrypted, there is no going back.
                            There is no way to reproduce the data out of the hash.
                            If you think about it - that does sound very logical. How could I leak such "dangerous" insights about the way this tool works, when it could be used 
                            against us. The only way to crack the encrypted passwords is by brute forcing - which means guessing. <LineBreak/>
                            The best way to avoid that is by choosing a strong password. A strong password has the minimum requierements of: <LineBreak/>
                            At least 8 characters. <LineBreak/>
                            At least one upper case character <LineBreak/>
                            At least one number <LineBreak/>
                            Sen's fortress offers a random password generator which makes sure, that you are picking a strong password. <LineBreak/>
                            <LineBreak/>
                            This tool also uses multi-factor authentication. This means that in order to enter the fortress, you have to at least enter your E-Mail adress
                            or phone number. You then receive a message containing a code that you have to submit before the gates are opened.
